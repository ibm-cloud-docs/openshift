# Setting up {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} in your {{site.data.keyword.redhat_openshift_notm}} cluster
{: #secrets-mgr}

When you integrate {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_full_notm}} with your {{site.data.keyword.openshiftlong_notm}} cluster, you can centrally manage Ingress subdomain certificates and other secrets. 
{: shortdesc}

## About {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}}
{: #secrets-mgr_about}

With {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}}, you can use a single service to manage your secrets and control who has access to them. A {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} instance is not automatically provisioned in your cluster. However, you can use a single {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} instance across multiple clusters, and a single cluster can have more than one instance.

### What functionality can I gain with {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}}?
{: #secrets-mgr_about_functionality}

With {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}}, you can:
- Create managed Kubernetes secrets with Ingress TLS certificates included.
- Create Kubernetes secrets of any type by using the CRN of any {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} instance you own.
- Automatically update your secrets in your cluster on a regular basis.
- Track the expiration dates of your certificates from the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console.
- Control who has access to your secrets by creating secret groups for approved users.

Note that to have your secrets automatically updated, you must register at least one {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} instance to your cluster. For more information, see [Registering your {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} instance to your cluster](#secrets-mgr_setup_register).
{: note}

## {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} FAQ
{: #secrets-mgr_migration_faq}

Keep the following points in mind when using {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}}.
{: shortdesc}

What types of secrets are supported with {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}}?
:   {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} supports IAM credentials, key-value secrets, user credentials, arbitrary secrets, and Kubernetes secrets. For Kubernetes secrets, {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} supports both TLS and non-TLS (Opaque) secret types. With TLS secrets, you can specify one certificate CRN. With non-TLS secrets, you can specify multiple fields to pull non-certificate secrets. If you do not specify a secret type when you create a secret, TLS is applied by default. For more information on supported secrets, see [Working with secrets of different types](/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-what-is-secret#secret-types).

Are secrets that are stored in a registered {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} instance automatically updated?
:   Yes. If you have a {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} instance registered to your cluster, the secrets on the cluster are automatically updated with the values from {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} once a day. These updates are made using the value of the secret from the corresponding CRN.

Are my secrets automatically updated if I do not create and register a {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} instance?
:   If you do not have a {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} instance registered to your cluster, your default Ingress secrets continue to update automatically every 90 days and are applied to your cluster. However, any secrets you created that *reference* the default Ingress secret are not automatically updated. 
:   **Example scenario**: You have a default Ingress certificate in the `default` namespace. You run the **`ibmcloud oc ingress secret create`** command and reference the CRN of the default Ingress certificate to mirror the certificate in the `istio-system` namespace. Without a {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} instance, the default Ingress certificate in the `default` namespace automatically updates. However, you are responsible for regularly updating the certificate in the `istio-system` namespace with the **`kubectl`** commands or another rotation method. 

I created secrets that reference the default Ingress certificate, but I have not created and registered a {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} instance. How do I manage my secrets?
:   If you don't register a {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} instance, {{site.data.keyword.openshiftlong_notm}} only automatically updates the default Ingress secret. You are responsible for managing any other secrets by using **`kubectl`** commands or another rotation method. If you have any secrets that reference the default Ingress certificate, you should remove them by using **`ibmcloud ks ingress secret rm`**.

What is the difference between the `ibmcloud oc ingress instance` CLI commands and the `ibmcloud oc ingress secret` CLI commands?
:   There are two sets of CLI commands that work directly with {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} instances in {{site.data.keyword.openshiftlong_notm}}: the `ibmcloud oc ingress secret` commands and the `ibmcloud oc ingress instance` commands. The `ibmcloud oc ingress instance` commands are used to manage your {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} instances. The `ibmcloud oc ingress secret` commands are used to manage your Ingress secrets that are stored in a {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} instance or secrets that are written directly to the cluster.

### Create a {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} instance
{: #secrets-mgr_setup_create}
{: step}

To create a {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} instance in the CLI or the UI, refer to the {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} documentation. It might take several minutes for you {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} instance to fully provision.
{: shortdesc}

- [Create a {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} instance in CLI](/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-create-instance&interface=cli).
- [Create a {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} instance in the UI](/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-create-instance).

When you create a {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} instance, it is not provisioned directly in your cluster. You must register your new {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} instance with your cluster in the next step. 
{: note}

### Register your {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} instance to your cluster
{: #secrets-mgr_setup_register}
{: step}

Follow the steps to register your {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} instance to your cluster.
{: shortdesc}

1. Get the CRN of the {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} instance. In the output, the CRN is in the **ID** row. 

    ```sh
    ibmcloud resource service-instance <instance_name>
    ```
    {: pre}

    Example output

    ```sh
    Name:                  my-secrets-manager-instance 
    ID:                    crn:v1:bluemix:public:secrets-manager:us-south:a/1aa111aa1a11111aaa1a1111aa1aa111:111a1111-11a1-111a-1111-1a1a1a1111a1:
    GUID:                  111a1111-11a1-111a-1111-1a1a1a1111a1 
    Location:              us-south   
    Service Name:          secrets-manager   
    Service Plan Name:     standard   
    Resource Group Name:   default   
    State:                 active   
    Type:                  service_instance   
    Sub Type:                 
    Created at:            2022-06-08T12:46:45Z   
    Created by:            user@ibm.com   
    Updated at:            2022-06-08T12:54:45Z 
    ```
    {: screen}

2. Register the instance to your cluster. Specify the instance CRN found in the previous step.

    If you want to register an instance to a cluster and also [set it as the default instance](#secrets-mgr_setup_default), include the `--is-default` option. Otherwise, you can set a default instance with the `ibmcloud oc ingress instance default set` command.
    {: tip}

    ```sh
    ibmcloud oc ingress instance register --cluster <cluster_name_or_id> --crn <instance_crn> [--is-default]
    ```
    {: pre}

3. Verify that the {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} instance was registered to the cluster. 

    ```sh
    ibmcloud oc ingress instance ls --cluster <cluster_name_or_id>
    ```
    {: pre}

    Example output

    ```sh
    Name                                Type              Is Default   Status    Secret Group   CRN   
    my-secrets-manager-instance         secrets-manager   false        created   default        crn:v1:bluemix:public:secrets-manager:us-south:a/1aa111aa1a11111aaa1a1111aa1aa111:111a1111-11a1-111a-1111-1a1a1a1111a1::   
    ```
    {: pre}


You can specify a {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} instance and a secret group when you [create a cluster](/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-clusters) with the [`ibmcloud oc cluster create classic`](/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-kubernetes-service-cli&interface=cli#cs_cluster_create) or [`ibmcloud oc cluster create vpc-gen2`](/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-kubernetes-service-cli&interface=cli#cli_cluster-create-vpc-gen2) commands. Use the `--sm-instance` option to register an instance to the cluster and the `--sm-group` option to specify a secret group that can access the secrets on the cluster. See [Registering a {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} instance when creating a cluster](#secrets-mgr_cluster_create).
{: tip} 

### Set a default {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} instance and regenerate your secrets
{: #secrets-mgr_setup_default}
{: step}

When you set a default {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} instance, all new Ingress subdomain certificates are stored in that instance.
{: shortdesc}

1. Run the command to set the new default instance. You can optionally specify a [secret group](/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-secret-groups) that is allowed access to the secrets in the instance. 

    ```sh
    ibmcloud oc ingress instance default set --cluster <cluster_name_or_id> --name <instance_name> --secret-group <secret_group_id>
    ```
    {: pre}

2. Regenerate your secrets. Any secrets that are managed by IBM, such as your default Ingress secrets, are uploaded to the new default instance. These secrets are automatically updated and the CRN is changed to reference the {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} instance.

    1. List the nlb-dns subdomains in your cluster.

        ```sh
        ibmcloud oc nlb-dns ls --cluster <cluster_name_or_id>
        ```
        {: pre}
  
    2. For each subdomain in your cluster, run the command to regenerate your IBM-managed secrets. This updates the CRN of these secrets to reference the CRN of the new default {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} instance.

        Regenerating your secrets is rate-limited to five times per week. Follow the steps in this document carefully, as repeating them might cause you to reach the limit. If you do not regenerate your secrets, or if you have reached the limit, your secrets are uploaded to your {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} instance at the next renewal cycle.
        {: important}

        ```sh
        ibmcloud oc nlb-dns secret regenerate --cluster <cluster_name_or_id> --nlb-subdomain <nlb_subdomain>
        ```
        {: pre}


    3. Verify that your default Ingress secrets regenerated. In the output, the CRN of the default Ingress secrets should contain `secrets-manager`.

        It might take several minutes for your secrets to regenerate. During this process, the **Status** column in the output says `regenerating` and switches to `created` when the regeneration is complete. 
        {: note}

        ```sh
        ibmcloud oc ingress secret ls --show-crn --cluster <cluster_name_or_id>
        ```
        {: pre}

        Example output

        ```sh
        Name                                Namespace   Expiry              Domains                                Status    Type   CRN
        secret-11111aa1a1a11aa1111111-000   default     3 months from now   secret-11111aa1a1a.us-s…domain.cloud   created   TLS    crn:v1:bluemix:public:secrets-manager:us-south:a/1aa111aa1:secret:a111aa11-11a1
        secret-22222aa2a2a22aa2222222-000   default     3 months from now   secret-22222aa2a2a.us-s…domain.cloud   created   TLS    crn:v1:bluemix:public:secrets-manager:us-south:a/2aa222aa2:secret:a222aa22-22a2   
        ```
        {: screen}

## Controlling access to your secrets with secret groups
{: #secrets-mgr_groups}

With {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}}, you can use secret groups to control who has access to the secrets in your cluster. A secret group can be assigned to an IAM access group so that only select users or service IDs can access the secrets within the secret group. For more information, see [Organizing your secrets](/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-secret-groups&interface=ui).
{: shortdesc}

## Registering a {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} instance when creating a cluster
{: #secrets-mgr_cluster_create}

If you are [creating a new Classic or VPC cluster](/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-clusters), you can register an existing {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} instance and secret group to the cluster during creation. Secrets in the cluster are stored in the {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} instance and applied to the secret group. 
{: shortdesc}

The {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} instance registered during cluster create does not automatically become the default {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} instance. You must still [set the default instance](#secrets-mgr_setup_default) manually.
{: note}

If you [create a cluster](/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-clusters) in the CLI with the [`ibmcloud oc cluster create classic`](/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-kubernetes-service-cli&interface=cli#cs_cluster_create) or [`ibmcloud oc cluster create vpc-gen2`](/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-kubernetes-service-cli&interface=cli#cli_cluster-create-vpc-gen2), you can specify a {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} instance or secret group with the following command options:
- `--sm-instance`: Use this option to register a {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} instance to the cluster by specifying the instance CRN. To find the CRN of a {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} instance, run `ibmcloud resource service-instance <name_of_instance>` or navigate to your resource list in the UI and click the instance.
- `--sm-group`: Use this option to specify the ID of the secret group. To find the secret group ID, run `ibmcloud secrets-manager secret-groups`.

If you create a cluster in the UI, follow these steps to specify a {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} instance or secret group:
1. In the **Integrations** section of the cluster create page, select the option to enable **Secrets Manager**.
2. From the **Secrets Manager instance** drop down menu, select the instance you want to register to the cluster. If no instances are available, [create one](#secrets-mgr_setup_create). 
3. From the **Secrets Manager group** drop down menu, select the secret group you want to apply. 
4. Create the cluster. 
5. Check that the {{site.data.keyword.secrets-manager_short}} instance is registered to the cluster.
    1. When your cluster is fully provisioned, click the cluster to view the cluster details. Under **Integrations**, find the **Secrets Manager** heading and click **Manage**. 
    2. In the side panel, check that correct instance is listed under **Registered Secrets Manager instances**.
    3. To register additional instances to the cluster, click **Register instances**.
