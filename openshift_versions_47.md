| Type | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| Kubernetes snapshot CRDs | {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} installs Kubernetes snapshot custom resource definition (CRD) version `v1beta1`. If you use other Kubernetes snapshot CRD versions `v1` or `v1alpha1`, you must change the version to `v1beta1`. To check the currently installed version of your snapshot CRDs, run `grep snapshot.storage.k8s.io <<(kubectl get apiservices)`. Follow the Kubernetes documentation to [Upgrade from v1alpha1 to v1beta1](https://github.com/kubernetes-csi/external-snapshotter#upgrade-from-v1alpha1-to-v1beta1){: external} to make sure that your snapshot CRDs are at the correct `v1beta1` version. The steps to downgrade from version `v1` to `v1beta1` are the same as those to upgrade from `v1alpha1`. Do not follow the instructions to upgrade from version `v1beta1` to version `v1`. |
