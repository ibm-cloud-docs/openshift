## Preparing to update
{: #prep-up-411}

Review changes that you might need to make when you [update a cluster](/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-update) to version 4.11. This information summarizes updates that are likely to have an impact on deployed apps when you update.
{: shortdesc}

**Before you update**: Review the following list of considerations and limitations before you update your cluster to version 4.11. Some entries are relevant to specific add-ons. To check if you have an add-on enabled in your cluster, run `ibmcloud oc cluster addon ls`. 

RHEL 8 operating system support 
:    RHEL 8 is the only operating system supported for clusters that run version 4.11. If your 4.10 cluster has RHEL 7 worker nodes, [migrate your worker nodes](#rhel-migrate-411) to RHEL 8.

Cluster autoscaler add-on
:    The cluster autoscaler add-on version 1.0.6 or newer is supported on {{site.data.keyword.openshiftshort}} version 4.11. 

Portworx
:    Portworx is supported on version 4.11. However, if you have Portworx installed, you must follow the steps to upgrade your installation to use at least image version `2.11.4`. For more information, see [Upgrading Portworx to a specific version](/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-storage_portworx_about).

{{site.data.keyword.redhat_openshift_notm}} Data Foundation (ODF)
:    ODF version 4.10 supports {{site.data.keyword.openshiftshort}} version 4.11 clusters. You might continue to use version 4.10 of the ODF add-on.

Extended update support (EUS)
:    EUS updates are not available at this time for clusters that run version 4.11.

Pod security admission
:   Version 4.11 enables a new [Pod security admission controller](https://docs.redhat.com/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.11/html/release_notes/ocp-4-11-release-notes#ocp-4-11-auth-pod-security-admission){: external}, which coexists with `SecurityContextConstraints`. The new pod security admission controller in version 4.11 includes warning messages and `kube-apiserver` audit events for pods that violate the Pod Security profile configured for the namespace. There is also a new `PodSecurityViolation "Information"` alert that is generated for pods that violate the pod security audit profile defined for that namespace. For more information about the pod security admission controller, see [Configuring Pod Security admission](/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-pod-security-admission).

### Update before master
{: #411_before}

The following table shows the actions that you must take before you [update the cluster master](/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-update#master).
{: shortdesc}

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Unsupported:** Deprecated and removed {{site.data.keyword.redhat_openshift_notm}} features | For more information, review the [{{site.data.keyword.redhat_openshift_notm}} version 4.11 deprecated and removed features](https://docs.redhat.com/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.11/html/release_notes/ocp-4-11-release-notes#ocp-4-11-deprecated-removed-features){: external}. |
| Known Red Hat OpenShift issues | For more information about possible required actions, review [Red Hat OpenShift version 4.11 known issues](https://docs.redhat.com/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.11/html/release_notes/ocp-4-11-release-notes#ocp-4-11-known-issues){: external}. |
| `LegacyServiceAccountTokenNoAutoGeneration` feature gate is enabled | For more information, review possible required actions in the `LegacyServiceAccountTokenNoAutoGeneration is on by default` section of the[{{site.data.keyword.redhat_openshift_notm}} version 4.11 notable technical changes](https://docs.redhat.com/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.11/html/release_notes/ocp-4-11-release-notes#ocp-4-11-notable-technical-changes). |
| Red Hat OpenShift web console redirect changed | Cluster server URL no longer redirects to the Red Hat OpenShift web console. You must add `/console` to the URL for the redirect. |
| The kubelet modifications that some Cloud Paks make are causing worker nodes to enter `Critical` when upgrading. | For more information, see [Why do I see a `failed to set feature gates` error when upgrading a worker node?](/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-ts-cloud-pak-ds). |

### Update after master
{: #411_after}

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Unsupported:** RHEL 7 worker nodes | Using RHEL 7 worker nodes with Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud version 4.11 clusters is unsupported. After updating the cluster master, if your cluster still has RHEL 7 worker nodes, [migrate your RHEL 7 worker nodes to RHEL 8](#rhel-migrate-411). |

## Migrating your worker nodes from RHEL 7 to RHEL 8
{: #rhel-migrate-411}

RHEL 8 is the default operating system supported for clusters that run version 4.11. RHEL 7, which is currently the default operating system for cluster versions 4.10 and earlier, is not supported in version 4.11. If you upgrade a cluster master from version 4.10 to 4.11, you must migrate your worker nodes from RHEL 7 to RHEL 8. You cannot upgrade RHEL 7 worker nodes directly to RHEL 8. Instead, after you have upgraded to 4.11, you must provision a new RHEL 8 worker pool in your 4.11 cluster and then remove the RHEL 7 worker pool. 
{: shortdesc}

For more information about creating worker pools and adding worker nodes, see [Adding worker nodes in classic clusters](/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-add-workers-classic) or [Adding worker nodes in VPC clusters](/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-add-workers-vpc).

1. [Upgrade your cluster master](/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-update#update) from version 4.10 to 4.11.

2. In your 4.11 cluster, create a new worker pool to contain your RHEL 8 worker nodes. Make sure that the number of nodes specified with the `--size-per-zone` option matches the number of RHEL 7 worker nodes that are to be replaced. By default, any worker nodes added to your new worker pool run RHEL 8.

    **For classic clusters**. See the [CLI reference](/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-kubernetes-service-cli#cs_worker_pool_create) for command details.

    ```sh
    ibmcloud oc worker-pool create classic --name <worker_pool_name> --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID> --flavor <flavor> --size-per-zone <number_of_workers_per_zone> 
    ```
    {: pre}

    **For VPC clusters**. See the [CLI reference](/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-kubernetes-service-cli#cli_worker_pool_create_vpc_gen2) for command details.

    ```sh
    ibmcloud oc worker-pool create vpc-gen2 --name <worker_pool_name> --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID> --flavor <flavor> --size-per-zone <number_of_workers_per_zone> 
    ```
    {: pre}

3. Verify that the worker pool is created.

    ```sh
    ibmcloud oc worker-pool ls --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID>
    ```
    {: pre}

4. Add a zone to your worker pool. When you add a zone, the number of worker nodes you specified with the `--size-per-zone` option are added to the zone. These worker nodes run the RHEL 8 operating system. 
    * [Adding a zone to a worker pool in a classic cluster](/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-add-workers-classic#add_zone)
    * [Adding a zone to a worker pool in a VPC cluster](/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-add-workers-vpc#vpc_add_zone)

5. Verify that worker nodes are available in your new worker pool. In the output, check the number in the **Workers** column for the worker pool.
    ```sh
    ibmcloud oc worker-pool ls --cluster <cluster_name_or-ID>
    ```
    {: pre}

6. [Remove the worker pool](/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-kubernetes-service-cli#cs_worker_pool_rm) that contains the RHEL 7 hosts. 

    Consider scaling down your RHEL 7 worker pool and keeping it for several days before you remove it. This way, you can easily scale the worker pool back up if your workload experiences disruptions during the migration process. After you remove the worker pool, you cannot provision another RHEL 7 worker pool if there are disruptions. When you have determined that your workload is stable and functions normally, you can safely remove the RHEL 7 worker pool.
    {: important}

    1. List your worker pools and note the name of the worker pool you want to remove.
        ```sh
        ibmcloud ks worker-pool ls --cluster CLUSTER [--output json] [-q]
        ```
        {: pre}

    2. Run the command to remove the worker pool.
        ```sh
        ibmcloud ks worker-pool rm --worker-pool WORKER_POOL --cluster CLUSTER [-q] [-f]
        ```
        {: pre}
