Montreal (`ca-mon`) MZR limitations
:   **Webhooks**: Only webhooks that access an in-cluster service work. Webhooks that directly access an external, out of cluster, URL are blocked.
:   **Operating systems**: You can only create clusters at version 4.16 and later in Montreal and can only use RHEL 9 or RHCOS workers nodes.

:   **Portworx Enterprise** and **Portworx Backup**: The default installation method for Portworx Enterprise and Portworx Backup is not yet supported for private-only clusters in the Montreal region. Contact Portworx Support if you need to install Portworx Enterprise or Portworx Backup in a private-only cluster in Montreal. For more information, see [Portworx Support](/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-storage_portworx_about#portworx-billing-support).
:   The Diagnostics and Debug Tool is currently not available in clusters in the Montreal (`ca-mon`) region.



## {{site.data.keyword.openshiftlong_notm}} locations
{: #locations}

Availability of a cluster is based on the type of cluster it is and how many replicas of the resources you have.
{: shortdesc}

The term `zone` in this document refers to different things depending the type of infrastructure being used. For VPC, the term `zone` refers to the zone names within an MZR, such as `us-south-1`. For Classic infrastructure, the term `zone` refers to a Classic data center, such as `dal10`. 
{: tip}

### Classic regions with multiple data centers
{: #zones-mz}

If you create a classic cluster with multiple data centers, the replicas of the highly available Kubernetes master are automatically spread across the data centers. You have the option to spread your worker nodes across classic zones (data centers) to protect your apps from a zone failure. To determine whether a classic region has multiple data centers from the CLI, your can run `ibmcloud oc locations` and look for the value in the `Multizone Metro` column.

### Classic regions with one data center
{: #zones-sz}

If you create a classic cluster in a region with only one data center, the highly available master includes three replicas on separate hosts, but is not spread across classic zones.
{: shortdesc}

Classic regions with one data center are managed from the regional endpoint located in the nearest region that supports classic data centers, such as `mon01` to `us-east` or `sao01` to `us-south`.

The Milan (`mil01`) datacenter is deprecated and closes on 31 October 2025. Migrate your {{site.data.keyword.openshiftlong_notm}} on IBM Cloud clusters currently hosted in `mil01` to another IBM Cloud datacenter by 31 October 2025.

### VPC multizone regions
{: #zones-vpc}

VPC resources are provisioned in a region, which is a separate group of zones within a metro. The zones are mapped to separate data centers to ensure that resources are distributed evenly across zones in a multizone architecture. In the API and CLI, zones use the regional zone name in the API and command line (`us-south-1`), but in the console, zones use by the data center location (`Dallas 1`). For the data center code that the VPC zone and location corresponds to, such as `us-south-1` and `DAL10`, see [Multizone regions](/docs/overview?topic=overview-locations#table-mzr).

## Where are the resources?
{: #regions_resources}

Where your resources are stored in the cluster depends on the availability of the cluster A cluster might be available in a single zone or multiple zones (multizone). 

### Resources in single zone clusters
{: #regions_single_zone}

Your cluster's resources remain in the data center in which the cluster is deployed, but management operations might be routed through a regional endpoint.
{: shortdesc}

Your cluster's resources, including the master and worker nodes, are in the same zone that you deployed the cluster to. When you initiate local container orchestration actions, such as `oc` commands, the information is exchanged between your master and worker nodes within the same zone.

If you set up other cluster resources, such as storage, networking, compute, or apps running in pods, the resources and their data remain in the data center that you deployed your cluster to.

When you initiate cluster management actions, such as running **`ibmcloud oc`** commands, basic information about the cluster such as name, ID, user, the command is routed through a regional endpoint and the global endpoint. 

### Resources in multizone clusters
{: #regions_multizone}

In multizone clusters, the cluster's resources are spread across multiple locations (zones for VPC and data centers for Classic) for higher availability.
{: shortdesc}

Worker nodes are spread across multiple VPC zones or Classic data centers in the region to provide more availability for your cluster. The Kubernetes master replicas are also spread across zones or classic data centers. When you initiate local container orchestration actions, such as **`oc`** commands, the information is exchanged between your master and worker nodes through the global endpoint.

Other cluster resources, such as storage, networking, compute, or apps running in pods, vary in how they deploy to the zones in your cluster. For more information, review these topics:
*   Setting up [file storage](/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-file_storage#add_file) and [block storage](/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-block_storage#add_block) in clusters, or [choosing a multizone persistent storage solution](/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-storage-plan).
*   [Enabling public or private access to an app by using a network load balancer (NLB) service in a cluster](/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-loadbalancer#multi_zone_config).
*   [Managing network traffic by using Ingress](/docs/containers?topic=containers-managed-ingress-about).
*   [Increasing the availability of your app](/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-app).

When you initiate cluster management actions, such as running [`ibmcloud oc` commands](/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-kubernetes-service-cli), basic information about the cluster, such as name, ID, user, the command is routed through the global endpoint.
