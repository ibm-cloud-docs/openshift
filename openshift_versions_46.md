### Update before master
{: #46_before}

The following table shows the actions that you must take before you [update the cluster master](/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-update#master).
{: shortdesc}

| Type | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| Kubernetes snapshot CRDs | {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} installs Kubernetes snapshot custom resource definition (CRD) version `v1beta1`. If you use other Kubernetes snapshot CRD versions `v1` or `v1alpha1`, you must change the version to `v1beta1`. To check the currently installed version of your snapshot CRDs, run `grep snapshot.storage.k8s.io <<(kubectl get apiservices)`. Follow the Kubernetes documentation to [Upgrade from v1alpha1 to v1beta1](https://github.com/kubernetes-csi/external-snapshotter#upgrade-from-v1alpha1-to-v1beta1){: external} to make sure that your snapshot CRDs are at the correct `v1beta1` version. The steps to downgrade from version `v1` to `v1beta1` are the same as those to upgrade from `v1alpha1`. Do not follow the instructions to upgrade from version `v1beta1` to version `v1`. |
| VPC clusters: App URL character length | DNS resolution is managed by the cluster's [virtual private endpoint (VPE)](/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-vpc-subnets#vpc_basics_vpe), which can resolve URLs up to 130 characters. If you expose apps in your cluster with URLs, such as the Ingress subdomain or {{site.data.keyword.redhat_openshift_notm}} routes, ensure that the URLs are 130 characters or fewer. For example, if you use an autogenerated route name in the format `<service_name>-<project>.<cluster_name>-<random_hash>-0000.<region>.containers.appdomain.cloud` that exceeds 130 characters, you might need to [create a route that uses a shorter, custom subdomain](/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-openshift_routes#routes-setup) instead. |
