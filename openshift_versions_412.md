## Preparing to update
{: #prep-up-412}

Review changes that you might need to make when you [update a cluster](/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-update) to version 4.12. This information summarizes updates that are likely to have an impact on deployed apps when you update.
{: shortdesc}

**Before you update**: Review the following list of considerations and limitations before you update your cluster to version 4.11. Some entries are relevant to specific add-ons. To check if you have an add-on enabled in your cluster, run `ibmcloud oc cluster addon ls`. 

Calico BGP password
:   When you upgrade your cluster to version 4.12, a [BGP password](https://docs.tigera.io/calico/latest/reference/resources/bgppeer#bgppassword){: external} is automatically configured for Calico. This might disrupt pod networking for several seconds while the BGP password configuration is applied.


### Update before master
{: #412_before}

The following table shows the actions that you must take before you [update the cluster master](/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-update#master).
{: shortdesc}

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Unsupported:** Deprecated and removed OpenShift features | For more information, review the [OpenShift version 4.12 deprecated and removed features](https://docs.redhat.com/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.12/html/release_notes/ocp-4-12-release-notes#ocp-4-12-deprecated-removed-features){: external} and [Preparing to update to OpenShift Container Platform 4.12](https://docs.redhat.com/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.12/html/updating_clusters/updating-cluster-prepare#updating-cluster-prepare){: external} for actions that might be required. |
| Known OpenShift issues | For information on actions that might be required, review the [OpenShift version 4.12 known issues](https://docs.redhat.com/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.12/html/release_notes/ocp-4-12-release-notes#ocp-4-12-known-issues){: external}. |
| Pod security admission synchronization | If an Operator is installed in a user-created `openshift-*` namespace, synchronization is turned on by default after a cluster service version (CSV) is created in the namespace. The synchronized label inherits the permissions of the service accounts in the namespace. See [Controlling pod security admission synchronization](https://docs.redhat.com/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.12/html/authentication_and_authorization/understanding-and-managing-pod-security-admission#security-context-constraints-psa-opting_understanding-and-managing-pod-security-admission){: external} for actions that might be required. |
| Application updates required for `natPortRange` changes. | If your app requires a larger number of egress network connections from `pod-network` pods to a destination that is external to the cluster, you might need to make updates. This applies if your app has more than 30,000 egress connections open on a single worker node simultaneously, or over 30,000 egress connections open on a single worker node within a few minutes. For more information, see [Why am I running out of SNAT ports for egress connections from pods in my cluster?](/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-ts-network-snat-125). |
| The kubelet modifications that some Cloud Paks make are causing worker nodes to enter `Critical` when upgrading. | For more information, see [Why do I see a `failed to set feature gates` error when upgrading a worker node?](/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-ts-cloud-pak-ds). |
